This is normal and doesn't affect your average monthly charges.

## Demand Charges (Q17: "What is a demand charge?")
Demand charges apply primarily to commercial/industrial customers:

**What It Measures**
- Your highest rate of electricity use (kW) during the billing period
- Usually measured in 15-minute intervals
- Reflects the infrastructure needed to serve your peak usage

**Why It Exists**
- The utility must have capacity ready for your highest usage
- Peaks often occur during hot afternoons (AC) or morning startups
- Infrastructure costs are recovered through demand charges

**How to Reduce It**
- Stagger startup of large equipment
- Avoid running multiple high-draw devices simultaneously
- Consider load management systems
- Shift flexible loads to off-peak hours

## Estimated vs. Actual Reads (Q13)
Your meter is typically read monthly by a meter reader or smart meter.

**Actual Read (Code: A)**
- Physical or electronic reading of your meter
- Most accurate billing method

**Estimated Read (Code: E)**
- Used when meter cannot be read (access issues, weather, etc.)
- Based on your historical usage patterns
- Corrected on next actual read

**Smart Meters**
- Transmit readings automatically
- Rarely require estimation
- Enable time-of-use rates and usage tracking

## Alternate Suppliers (Q16: "Why am I charged by a different supplier?")
In deregulated markets, you may choose your energy supplier:

**How It Works**
- Your utility delivers energy (distribution charges)
- A separate supplier provides the energy itself (supply charges)
- Both charges appear on your utility bill

**If You Have an Alternate Supplier**
- You signed up with a competitive supplier (ESCO)
- Supply charges are set by that company, not the utility
- To switch back, contact the supplier or call us

**Questions About Your Supplier**
- Supplier name appears on your bill
- Contact them directly about supply rates
- Utility cannot modify supplier charges
